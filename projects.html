                            <p>This website is an individual project assigned to everyone as part of our year 1 mid-semester exams. Before tackling this task, I have attempted to build websites in the past, attempting to build solutions to everyday problems faced in school, like the fact that not everyone knew what homework to do, or that some people have trouble remembering what time their class starts. So, I attempted to fix them by building a website. Essentially, what I am saying is that I have the necessary experience to build a website, just that I am quite rusty, so the lessons I learnt from SP are incredibly useful in jogging my memory. If you want to, you can gander at the source code on github through the below link. </p>

                            <p>I host minecraft servers for my friends, and have been doing so ever since Secondary 1. I use a variety of different methods, including using Spigot, a very popular 3rd-party minecraft server and Vanilla, which is provided by Microsoft through Mojang. I have hosted them in different envrionments, some of which are Windows, which a server is currently running on, Linux on a dedicated server and macOS in the earlier days. Join us!</p>
