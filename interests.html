                            <p>Other than software, I love doing hardware projects as well. For example, the mentioned minecraft server is built by yours truly. To build my computers, I do thorough research on whether the parts I pick are compatible with one another. To do that, I google the information or use PC Part Picker, which is a really useful website that guides you along the building process and tells you whether your parts are compatible or not. </p>

                            <p><strong><em>Nerf this!</em></strong> Overwatch is a team-based shooter developed by Blizzard in 2015. It is a fast paced game, with so much happening all at once, but despite all of that, it is exhilarating playing this game. The community is really nice too, which is somewhat rare in this genre.</p>

                            <p><strong><em>Sssssss...</em></strong> Minecraft is a hyper-successful game developed by Mojang all the way back in 2011, with tens of millions of copies sold. It slowly lost popularity over the years, but has received a strange revitalisation in recent months. I love this game to bits, since the creativity you can unleash here is unparallelled and the potential is near infinite. </p>

                            <p>Every Friday, I run a D&amp;D campaign for my friends. Although I am not that good as a Dungeon Master, or DM, I am always learning how to be a better DM for my friends, so that they can have a more fun in any session I run. I make good use of websites like D&amp;D Beyond to help augment the campaigns, as it allows me to quickly search for different things like spells and monster stats. <strong>If you want to join me, you can indicate your interest below, or email me at <a href='mailto:angyakhng8000@gmail.com'>angyakhng8000@gmail.com</a>.</strong></p>

                            <p><strong><em>Nine-Nine!</em></strong> This show is a hilarious comedy series based around detectives working in a police precinct. I watch this quite often, as it is really rewatchable. If you have not seen this show yet, I highly recommend that you do so.</p>
